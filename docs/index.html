    <h1>Thinkstats - a tale of two books</h1>
    
    This URL was originally registered by Russ Poldrack to host his book titled “Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century”.<p>

    It was subsequently brought to his attention that there already existed a book called <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/"> “ThinkStats” by Allen Downey</a>.<p>

    In order to prevent confusion between the two books, Dr. Poldrack’s book can now be found at <a href="http://statsthinking21.org">statsthinking21.org</a>.
